      Ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were
      the
      <strong
        >first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant</strong
      >.<br />The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of
      the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts
      of <em>Ahmed al-Ghaffar</em> in Yemen.

    <h2>There are three major products::</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Home Blend</h3>
    <a href="https://homeblendcoffee.com/" target="blank"

    /></a>
    <p>
      They are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you
      can count on.<br />
      The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast
      blend or espresso roast – <br />meaning that when you pour a cup of a
      house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere<br />
      in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have intermediate
      flavor.

    <h3>French Roast</h3>
    <a
      href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/french-roast-coffee-765178#:~:text=French%20roast%20coffee%20is%20a,as%20a%20'burnt'%20coffee."
      ><img src="/images/frenchroast.jpg" alt="Home Blend" width="300"
    /></a>
    <p>
      French roast coffee is a popular style and one that many coffee drinkers
      prefer.<br />
      This dark roasted coffee has a smoky sweetness and can often have a
      charred taste.<br />
      This has caused some coffee geeks to refer to it as a 'burnt' coffee
    </p>

    <h3>Columbia Roast</h3>
    <a href="https://homeblendcoffee.com/"

    /></a>
    <p>
      Colombian coffee is renowned the world over for its quality and delicious
      taste;<br />
      in fact, along with a couple of other countries, Colombia’s coffee is
      generally<br />
      seen as some of the best in the world. But what makes one country’s<br />
      coffee better than another’s? Isn’t it all just coffee? The simple is no
